# Spam_Detection_In_Emails_Using_BERT
There have been introduced several models and ways to automatically detect spam emails. Both machine learning and deep learning algorithms outperformed all other proposed models. The models' accuracy was improved via natural language processing (NLP).  This project introduces the usefulness of BERT for categorizing spam emails.
